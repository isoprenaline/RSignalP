# RSignalP
Prediction of transmembrane helices in proteins by SignalP-5.0 Server ( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP ), a big Thanks to SignalP! Input a csv file with Ensembl Gene IDs and output 4 files in "~/RSignalP". Work in Windows10 with Chrome, need biomaRt, RSelenium and Chromedriver. Protein sequences should be not less than 10 amino acids. The maximum number of proteins is 5000.
